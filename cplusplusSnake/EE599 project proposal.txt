Going to work alone


Two project ideas, unsure which I will do-- it depends on feedback and on how much I enjoy the new material


Soccer Statistician
Record stats live about playing time, shots, assists, goals, and more! Backend posting this to a website where players/parents can log in, with access, and view stats for each game and for a season, ect. Using Node and whatever other cool tools we learn this year. 


Backup project idea: snake C++ game 
Using some open GL library to give a retro snake game feel. User interaction through arrow keys for controlling the snake. Possibility to make it cooler by allowing the head of the snake to shoot a laser, cutting part of its own tail off, but staying alive, if itâ€™s about to run into its own tail.
